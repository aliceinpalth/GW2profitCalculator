GW2profitCalculator
================

# Details and usage:
A profit calculating program coded in Python for the online video game MMORPG "Guild Wars 2" which features a fully functioning economy using virtual currency. One way to obtain a profit within the game is to buy raw materials off of the "Auction House" (where players buy and sell items to other players), use those materials to craft certain items, and then sell those crafted items.

This calculator takes the current price of the raw materials, the current price of the crafted item being sold, and the amount of the crafted item being sold. It then outputs the profit that the player will receive if they were to go forth with the crafting and selling at that time.

Enter the price of the materials using gold as a whole number (eg: *3g 56s 4c* = *3.5604*).

# Features:
* Color coded profit number indicates a positive (green) or negative (red) profit margin.
* Window will always stay on top of all windows on the desktop, allowing the calculator to be visible while the game is being played.
* Can be compiled as a executable for easier use.

# Basic overview:

Uses Python's GUI package Tkinter and basic mathematics as well as user input to output a value.
